# Overview

This repository contains the source code for a front-end of the web application structured into two main folders: `Components` and `Pages`, both located under the `src` directory. The project is designed to ensure modularity and separation of concerns, with each page and component having its own JavaScript and CSS files for functionality and styling, respectively.

## Folder Structure

### `src` Folder

* Components: Contains reusable UI components.
  
  * Navigation Bar: The navigation bar component.
  * Global Background Color Function: A function to retrieve background colors for text components in Activity Four and Five, ensuring colors are not repeated between these activities.

* Pages: Contains code for different pages of the application.

  * Home Page: The landing and dashboard pages.
    
    * dashboard/: Contains code for displaying instructor/student activities when logged in.
    * home.js: The main home page file.
    * welcomeScreen.js: Acts as the landing page when users are not logged in.
      
  * Activity Pages: Six folders, each dedicated to an individual activity (Activity One to Six). Each activity folder contains:
    
    * .js file: Contains the main functionality.
    * .css file: Contains the styling.
    * TranscriptPreview.js: Stores code for displaying the current transcript entered by the user.
      
### `App.js`

* This file contains the route definitions for the website, mapping different URLs to their respective components and pages.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
